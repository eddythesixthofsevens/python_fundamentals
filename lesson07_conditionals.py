# Challenge 1: Even or Odd
# Ask the user for a number, and tell them if itâ€™s even or odd.
# Example output:
# Enter a number: 7
# 7 is odd.
# Hint: use modulus operator

# number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# even_or_odd = number % 2
# if even_or_odd == 1:

# Challenge 2: Password Check
# Create a variable with a stored password
# Ask the user to enter a password. 
# If it matches the stored password, print "Access granted." Otherwise, "Access denied."
# Example output:
# Enter password: dolphin
# Access granted. Access denied.
# Enter password: swordfish
# Access granted.

# password = "pyramids!"
# insert_pass = input("Enter a password: ")
# if password == insert_pass:
#     print("Access granted.")
# else:
#     print("Access denied.")

# Challenge 3: Grading System
# Ask the user for a numeric grade (0-100) and print a letter grade.
# Example output:
# Enter your grade: 94
# You earned an A.

grade = int(input("Enter a grade (1-100): "))
